# Launching Machine Learning: Delivering Operational Success with Gold Standard ML Leadership

# About this Course
Machine learning runs the world. It generates predictions for each individual customer, employee, voter, and suspect, and these predictions drive millions of business decisions more effectively, determining whom to call, mail, approve, test, diagnose, warn, investigate, incarcerate, set up on a date, or medicate. But, to make this work, you've got to bridge what is a prevalent gap between business leadership and technical know-how. Launching machine learning is as much a management endeavor as a technical one. Its success relies on a very particular business leadership practice. This means that two different species must cooperate in harmony: the business leader and the quant. 

This course will guide you to lead or participate in the end-to-end implementation of machine learning (aka predictive analytics). Unlike most machine learning courses, it prepares you to avoid the most common management mistake that derails machine learning projects: jumping straight into the number crunching before establishing and planning for a path to operational deployment.

Whether you'll participate on the business or tech side of a machine learning project, this course delivers essential, pertinent know-how. You'll learn the business-level fundamentals needed to ensure the core technology works within – and successfully produces value for – business operations. If you're more a quant than a business leader, you’ll find this is a rare opportunity to ramp up on the business side, since technical ML trainings don’t usually go there. But know this: The soft skills are often the hard ones.

After this course, you will be able to:
* Apply ML: Identify the opportunities where machine learning can improve marketing, sales, financial credit scoring, insurance, fraud detection, and much more.
* Plan ML: Determine the way in which machine learning will be operationally integrated and deployed, and the staffing and data requirements to get there. 
* Greenlight ML: Forecast the effectiveness of a machine learning project and then internally sell it, gaining buy-in from your colleagues.
* Lead ML: Manage a machine learning project, from the generation of predictive models to their launch.
* Prep data for ML: Oversee the data preparation, which is directly informed by business priorities.
* Evaluate ML: Report on the performance of predictive models in business terms, such as profit and ROI.
* Regulate ML: Manage ethical pitfalls, such as when predictive models reveal sensitive information about individuals, including whether they're pregnant, will quit their job, or may be arrested – aka AI ethics.
