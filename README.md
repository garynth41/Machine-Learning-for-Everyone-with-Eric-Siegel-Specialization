# Machine-Learning-for-Everyone-with-Eric-Siegel-Specialization

An End-to-End Guide That Empowers You to Launch ML. This expansive machine learning curriculum is accessible to business-level learners and yet vital to techies as well. It covers both the state-of-the-art techniques and the business-side best practices.


# WHAT YOU WILL LEARN
* Lead ML: Manage or participate in the end-to-end implementation of machine learning
* Apply ML: Identify the opportunities where machine learning can improve marketing, sales, financial credit scoring, insurance, fraud detection, and much more
* Greenlight ML: Forecast the effectiveness of and scope the requirements for a machine learning project and then internally sell it to gain buy-in
* Regulate ML: Manage ethical pitfalls, the risks to social justice that stem from machine learning – aka AI ethics


# SKILLS GAINED
* Data Science
* Artificial Intelligence (AI)
* Equitable Algorithms
* Machine Learning
* Predictive Analytics
* Ethics Of Artificial Intelligence
* Machine learning strategy and leadership
* Machine Learning (ML) Algorithms


# About this Specialization
Machine learning reinvents industries and runs the world. Harvard Business Review calls it “the most important general-purpose technology of our era.”But while there are many how-to courses for hands-on techies, there are practically none that also serve business leaders – a striking omission, since success with machine learning relies on a very particular business leadership practice just as much as it relies on adept number crunching.

This specialization fills that gap. It empowers you to generate value with ML by ramping you up on both the tech and business sides – both the cutting edge algorithms and the project management skills needed for successful deployment.NO HANDS-ON AND NO HEAVY MATH. Rather than a hands-on training, this specialization serves both business leaders and burgeoning data scientists with expansive, holistic coverage.

BUT TECHNICAL LEARNERS SHOULD TAKE ANOTHER LOOK. Before jumping straight into the hands-on, as quants are inclined to do, consider one thing: This curriculum provides complementary know-how that all great techies also need to master. It guides you on the end-to-end process required to successfully deploy ML so that it delivers a business impact.

WHAT YOU'LL LEARN. How ML works, how to report on its ROI and predictive performance, best practices to lead an ML project, technical tips and tricks, how to avoid the major pitfalls, whether true AI is coming or is just a myth, and the risks to social justice that stem from ML.


# Applied Learning Project
For one exercise, create a predictive model by hand in Excel or Google Sheets and visualize how it improves before your eyes. Beyond this, there are no exercises involving the use of ML software.

Vendor-Neutral
This specialization includes several illuminating software demos of ML in action using SAS products. However, the curriculum is vendor-neutral and universally-applicable. The learnings apply, regardless of which ML software you end up choosing to work with.

# In-Depth Yet Accessible
Brought to you by a veteran industry leader who won teaching awards when he was a professor at Columbia University, this specialization stands out as one of the most thorough, engaging, and surprisingly accessible on the subject of ML.

# Like a University Course
These three courses are also a good fit for college students, or for those planning for or currently enrolled in an MBA program. The breadth and depth of this specialization is equivalent to one full-semester MBA or graduate-level course.
